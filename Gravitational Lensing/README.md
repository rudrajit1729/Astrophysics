## What Is Gravitational Lensing?
### Dark Matter
Dark matter is an invisible form of matter that makes up most of the universe's mass and creates its underlying structure. Dark matter's gravity drives normal matter (gas and dust) to collect and build up into stars and galaxies.

Since it is causing gases to cluster around, it must bend the space time around it due to its gravity thus creating a gravitational lens. Thus light passing through the space fabric will be bent when it crosses a dark matter field. Detection of the bending of the electromagnetic wave will confirm the presence of dark matter in space.

### A Brief Introduction
In 1915, Albert Einstein told us that any form of matter and energy bends spacetime. Since light travels in straight lines in spacetime, if spacetime is bent, then the paths of light rays will also be bent. This effect allows light to bend around regions of space with a lot of mass. We call this Gravitational Lensing.


Lensing was first confirmed by Sir Arthur Eddington in 1919 when he observed a background star being deflected by the Sun. Today, astronomers observe lensing all around us. In fact, it is one of the primary tools used to measure the amount of <b>Dark Matter</b> in the Universe. When astronomers observe massive clusters of galaxies, they can get lucky and also observe a background galaxy that is being gravitationally lensed by the galaxy cluster. The amount of distortions tells astronomers about the size and shape of the unseen Dark Matter distribution around the galaxy cluster. This allows us to <i>indirectly</i> measure where the Dark Matter is located on the largest scales of the Universe.

## Goal of the activity
In this activity, we will simulate the effect of Gravitational Lensing and come away with a better understanding of how astronomers measure the properties of the \"lens\" by observing the multiple \"images\" of a background galaxy.
