# Simulation of a Correlated Field of Galaxies
## Context
Starburst galaxies are observed to be forming stars at an exceptionally high rate, about 10^3  times greater than observed in most galaxies, and are very bright in infrared. This phenomenon is linked to interactions or collisions between galaxies. The study of the spatial distribution of those galaxies allow us to better understand how interactions between galaxies affect star-formation and galaxy evolution. There are two statistical ways to determine the spatial distribution of galaxies: the spatial correlation function and the power spectrum of cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to simulate a map of the sky in square degrees, containing points representing a correlated field of galaxies.

## Description of the Project
- Create a map with random galaxy distribution.
- Determine galaxy count at a given flux in far-infrared to build a map of Poisson distribution of galaxies.
- Spatially correlate the sources using the power spectrum of the CIB.
